# HelpforHaiti
### A website for the Hope for Haiti project.

Haiti is mired in poverty. Its people are starving and dying, and many of them live in what are little better than hovels. Some don't even have those. Eight out of every hundred Haitian children will not survive to their first birthday.

> *The future of Haiti must be linked to the respect of the rights of every single citizen.*

> \-Jean Bertrand Aristide

Haiti needs our help. And we need to be strong enough to give it. Donate now.
