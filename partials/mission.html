<h1 class='header'>Our Mission</h1>

    <p id='cont-p'>Our mission is to help the refugees of the crisis in Syria, by sending them aid through the UN Foundation for Refugees. Our money will help them regain their independence, their dignity, and their means of survival. The world seems to be largely ignoring the plight of the Syrian refugees (Hungary built a fence to keep them out, but that's about it) and we think that our donations will truly make a difference in these peoples' lives. Our plan, we believe, is the best possible to get as much money as we can over to the refugees, and the UN is a reputable organization. Working together, we can make a major difference.</p>

    <p id='cont-p'>If you need help with anything, have a question, or want something approved, don't hesitate to let us know. Our emails should come up when you type our names into the 'name' space in your school email. We will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
