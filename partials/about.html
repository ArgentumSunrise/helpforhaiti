        <p id='cont-p'>HelpforHaiti is the site for Mrs. Clark's English class. We are a group of students focusing on a unique and complicated issue- the starvation and poverty that is devastating the people of Haiti. Haiti is the poorest country in the Americas, with over half of its population living on under a dollar a day. Its people are ravaged by disease, malnutrition and violence. Most of the damage from the earthquake goes unfixed, leaving many people to live in ruins. Eight out of every one hundred children in Haiti don't reach their first birthday. And that's why we decided to try and help them. With several charitable events that we'll stage throughout our school, we hope to raise enough money to pull some of these people out of the abject poverty that has become their daily existence.</p> <!-- Statistics from http://haitipartners.org/about-us/haiti-statistics/ -->

        <p id='cont-p'>If you need help with anything, have a question, or want something approved, don't hesitate to let us know. Haiti needs our help, and we have to be strong enough and dedicated enough to give it.</p>
